# Bevy RTS Prototype

Revived version of [rts_prototype](https://github.com/guimcaballero/rts_prototype) to give a sample how rts like game
can be implemented with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## TODOs

- [x] update APIs to 7.0 (latest as of 2022-6-19)
- [-] targeted bullet (basic working, but got some problems..)
- [ ] separate systems to plugins for future reuse
- more?
